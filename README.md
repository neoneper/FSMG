Doc: https://github.com/neoneper/FSMG/wiki

It is a graphic finite state machine maked in Unity, developed to work with artificial intelligence.
The FSMgraph was designed to be fully expandable.
It allows the creation of global and local variables, as well as customized routes, without the need for programming and multiples IA can be using the same graph too.

It is still in the testing phase.

- Allows multiple IAs per Graph.
- Creation of local and global variables directly on the graph.
- Creation of direct local and global routes on the graph.
- 100% PlugAndPlay. You can create new states or just new ones.
- All categories of actions (Actions, Decisions and States) have an "API", which allows the user to create a custom resource for them, in case the user does not want to create new blocks.
-------------------------------------------
FSMG reports still being born, i spended a lot of time developing and there i stilled no active time to document or to work with real use cases.

Anyway. It is open to anyone who wants to contribute or use only. User comments are welcome.
Fell free to use and to help improve.
